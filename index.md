# Preamble

Keizaal is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesdaâ€™s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. The following are the core pillars of this list:

1. **This modlist intends to maintain the Vanilla feel.** I want everything to feel like it belongs in the base game. No new complicated systems or anything that requires a manual to understand. This is a simple modlist, you can experience the content as if it was always there.
2. **Immersion is paramount.** I'm a lore buff and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore accurate or takes me out of the game in any way it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category, if a mod has a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods then it will probably not be included.  
3. **Mods must have decent longevity.** This modlist wants to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.  
4. **Stability is the most important thing.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.
