# Preamble

Keizaal is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesdaâ€™s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. The following are the core pillars of this list:

1. **This modlist intends to maintain the Vanilla feel.** I want everything to feel like it belongs in the base game. No new complicated systems or anything that requires a manual to understand. This is a simple modlist, you can experience the content as if it was always there.
2. **Immersion is paramount.** I'm a lore buff and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore accurate or takes me out of the game in any way it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category, if a mod has a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods then it will probably not be included.  
3. **Mods must have decent longevity.** This modlist wants to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.  
4. **Stability is the most important thing.** This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns it will be quickly cut.

You can find a full list of the mods included in Keizaal [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/keizaal){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you feel like this modlist is for you, click [here](https://keizaal.github.io/Keizaal/INSTALLATIONGUIDE.html) to go straight to the installation guide. If you want to know more I have included a breif overview below.

# Overview

The main package of mods can be easily broken down into two major sections: Things to Do and Places to Go. Within these sections individual mods that I think are important to the overall experience of the modlist will be highlighted. There are a lot of mods that make Keizaal what it is and every mod has a place to contribute towards that goal, but I consider the following to be "cornerstone mods" that will give you a good idea of what the list will be like.

## Things to Do

While it may not be obvious on first glance there are a lot of fun new things that you can do in Keizaal. A lot of the gameplay systems have been overhauled and several quests have been given a facelift. Additionally there are a few interesting characters that you can meet and some new mechanics you can use to interact with the world in new and exciting ways.

### [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)

Mysticism is an overhaul of Skyrim's magic. It make changes to existing vanilla spells as well as expanding to include some new and exciting spells. The mod does a good job of integrating everything into the game in such a manner that it feels like a natural extension. None of the spells stick out much and it gives you a better progression from Noivce to Master. You actually *feel* like a Master when you get to that level and it opens up a lot of fun and powerful spells you can use that level. In vanilla Master spells were rather underwelming, in Mysticism they feel great.

### [Adamant - A Perk Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/30191/30191-1572896988-939425731.png)

Adamant is Keizaal's perk overhaul and it aims to expands the perk trees and over some fun new playstyles without growing too bloated and straying away from the feel of the vanilla system. Every tree has been given a proper facelift and a lot of the new perks push you to try new and interesting things. In the Heavy Armor three there is a branch dedicataed to building an Unarmed character, something that is nearly impossible in vanilla. In the Speech tree there are perks to help build a shout-focused character. These are only a few of the things you can do in Adamant. Additionally, Mysticism is integrated into Adamant, new spell types are given perks which helps to make the two mods feels nicely integrated and connected to the base game.

### [Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/34549/34549-1586478221-885699905.png)

Vanilla Skyrim combat is pretty easy without much counterplay. Some people try to fix this by turning Skyrim into Dark Souls, I believe this goal is fudamantally flawed. Blade and Blunt seeks to take what is already there and Vanilla and rework it in such a way that it is still Skyrim, but with more interesting and engaging gameplay. Foremost in this goal is to make Stamina more important. Glow Stamina in Vanilla is usually just mildly annoying, in Blade and Blunt it could be deadly. Resource management is the name of the game in this mod and delicately balancing your Health, Magicka, and Stamina leads to some very interesting combat encounters that you just would not have in Vanilla.

### [Save the Icerunner - Lights Out Alternate Routes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/34681/34681-1586812498-1669244761.png)

Skyrim generally gives you a good amount of choice in morally questionable quests. Usually there is a good route and a bad route, even the Dark Brotherhood questline gives you an optional route to destroy the faction. However, Lights Out is quest that not only doesn't give you a "good" alternative but also makes it so the only route forward is for your character to get duped, even if you have figured out what is happening. Save the Icerunner is a fantastic rework of the quest that keep the core foundation intact while giving the Player more options as to how to tackle the events presented to them. Choosing the "good" route will even make a permanant and visible change to the gameworld to show how you have effected things for the better.

### [Dark Brotherhood Rising Revengeance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57157)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/57157/57157-1635033224-1126171269.png)

Speaking of the Dark Brotherhood, while it does give you to option to destroy the faction rather than join it you are still required to take some morally questionable actions. The kind of things you need to do would generally be something that a lot of good characters would refuse to ever partake in. So while there was a "good" route for the Dark Brotherhood questline it was awkward for good characters to start it which often led to these kind of characters just never doing the quest. This is a shame because destroying the Dark Brotherhood is a great piece of role-play that a lot of good characters would like to do. Dark Brotherhood Rising Revengeance seek to remedy that by giving the Player an alternative path to starting the Destroy the Dark Brotherhood quest. This new path is compatible with good characters and integrated very well in a manner that feels natural with the rest of the vanilla quest.

### [House of Horrors - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/57285/57285-1634858440-22571931.jpeg)

Another quest that sorely needed a "good" path was House of Horrors. This quest is one of the worst offenders in this category because it tricks the Player into thinking they are starting a quest suited for good guys and then they are quickly blindsided into a Daedric quest where there is no alternative to being a bad guy beyond letting the quest sit in your jounrnal forever incomplate. House of Horrors - Quest Expansion adds a new route to take that will allow you to spite the evil prince and will unlock use of a brand new follower.

### [The Only Cure - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57683)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/57683/57683-1636156671-113565713.jpeg)

While not nearly as bad as House of Horrors, the Only Cure also had an issue of forcing the Player down a single path that involved stating their alligence to Peryite. The Only Cure - Quest Expansion gives you another route which involves rejecting Peryite. You can also optionally finish the quest on your own terms because you believe it is right as opposed to following the whims of a Daedric prince.

### [Headhunter - Bounties Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847)
![]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/51847/108240-1624891883-844138837.jpeg

While I don't think there is anything inherently wrong from the Vanilla bounty system I cannot deny that Headhunter does improve it. You will now need to provide proof when you go to a bandit camp and clear it out, no longer will the jarl believe you just because you said so. Proof can be provided in two ways: either by arresting the chief of the camp alive, or bringing their head back in a bag. There isn't much more to it than that, but this mod does expand roleplay opportunities which is always a good thing.

### [Lawbringer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/29882/29882-1571724157-1690149741.png)

There are a lot of locations around Skyrim that are inhabitated with bandits and make travel in those places dangerous. You are unable to clear these place permenantly, they will always respawn with bandits and the circle of banditry will never end. Lawbringer is a great mod that allows you to claim locations around Skyrim for a faction of your choice, ensuring that it will only respawn in the future with friendly NPCs. It is really enjoyable to claim locations and see a tangible impact on the world around you. Places like Valtheim Keep and Pine Watch Bridge are fun locations because they are bandit camps stationed on the roadway, so claiming feels very impactful. Lawbringer only covers the Skyrim worldspace itself but I have personally expanded functionality to several other worldspaces in my mods [House Rule](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57243), [Wyrm Tamer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55190), and [Imperial Law](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57099).

### [Lucien - Immersive Fully Voiced Male Follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035)
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/20035/20035-1537353342-139023144.png)

It is no secret that the vast majority of followers in Vanilla Skyrim are basically nothing more than a pack mule and canon fodder. Fallout 4 rectified these problems by making every follower in that game interesting with a distinct personality and a special quest connected directly to all of them. Lucien is a mod that feels a lot more like Bethesda's more recent attempts at followers. Lucien has a distinct personality that is often the opposite of most of the followers that you'd be used to. He is no warrior, he is a young and unexperienced scholar with next to no real-world experience. You get to adventure alongside Lucien and see how his character develops as you travel together. He really feels like a memeber of your party of heroes as opposed to just a lifeless thrall.

### [Gladys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164) and [Merlin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433) the Corgis
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/56433/56433-1633528377-651139291.png)

These are mods that I made for my own amusement that other people seem to enjoy. They are two seperate mods but they do much the same thing: add a new corgi follower to the game. Both of these dogs are based on my own pet corgis complete with creature audio that was sourced from each of my dogs respectively. The two of them cover different roles. Gladys formorly belonged to a merchant and is good at carrying things in her backpack, she is also very adapt at finding interesting loot in the world to bring back to you. Merlin on the other hand is a combat-focused follower, he is unable to carry anything but he makes up for it due to his effectiveness in combat. He is able to use magic in order to transform between three different primordial elemental forms based on the type of enemy he is fighting, when in this form he will do powerful AOE damange in addition to his bites. While main point of these followers is to be cute, they are also pretty useful in your adventures.
