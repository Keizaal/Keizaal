   GitHub Pages seems to have an "invisible" default theme for Jekyll sites that 
   just completely blows up half of HTML's repertoire -- clearing padding and 
   margin off of all lists, setting all elements to border-box sizing...
   
   Hopefully using a dummy "empty" theme file will salvage this.
